                    <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orville_Gibson" target="blank">Orville Gibson</a> (born 1856) patented a single-piece mandolin design in 1898 that was more durable than other mandolins and could be manufactured in volume. Orville Gibson began to sell his instruments in 1894 out of a one-room workshop in Kalamazoo Michigan. In 1902 Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co, Ltd. was incorporated to market the instruments. Initially, the company produced only Orville Gibson's original designs. Orville died in 1918.</p>


                    <p>The following year the company hired designer <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Loar" target="blank">Lloyd Loar</a> to create newer instruments. Loar designed the flagship L-5 archtop guitar and the Gibson F5 mandolin that was introduced in 1922, before leaving the company in 1924. In 1936 Gibson introduced their first "Electric Spanish" model, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_ES-150" target="blank">ES-150</a> followed by other electric instruments like steel guitars, banjos and mandolins.</p>

                    <p>In the spring of 1935, Gibson enlisted musician <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvino_Rey" target="blank">Alvino Rey</a> to help develop a prototype pickup with engineers at the Lyon & Healy company in Chicago. Later that year, research was moved in-house, where Gibson employee Walter Fuller came up with the final design. Gibson introduced the distinctive hexagonal pickup on a lap steel model in late 1935. The pickup was installed on an F-hole archtop guitar, dubbed the ES-150 ES for Electric Spanish), and the first one shipped from the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on May 20, 1936.</p>

                    <p>In the years after World War II, the electric guitar came of age and Gibson entered a golden of age of innovation. The P-90 pickup, introduced in 1946, gave guitarists new power and versatility. Under the aggressive leadership of company president <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_McCarty" target="blank">Ted McCarty</a>, Gibson debuted two new concepts in 1949 with the ES-5, the first three-pickup guitar, and the <a href = "http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/ES/Gibson-Memphis/ES-175.aspx" target="blank">ES-175</a>, the first guitar with a sharply pointed cutaway bout.</p>
                    <p>n the late 50s, McCarty knew that Gibson was seen as a traditional company and began an effort to create more modern guitars. In 1961 the body design of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Paul" target="blank">Les Paul</a> was changed due to the demand for a double-cutaway body design. The new body design then became known as the SG (for "solid guitar"), due to disapproval from Les Paul himself. Between 1974 and 1984 production of Gibson guitars was shifted from Kalamazoo to Nashville, Tennessee. The Kalamazoo plant kept going for a few years as a custom-instrument shop, but was closed in 1984; several Gibson employees led by plant manager Jim Duerloo established Heritage Guitars in the old factory, building versions of classic Gibson designs.</p>
                    <p>The company (Gibson) was within three months of going out of business before it was bought by Henry E. Juszkiewicz, David H. Berryman, and Gary A. Zebrowski in January 1986. New production plants were opened in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as Bozeman, Montana. The Memphis facility is used for semi-hollow and custom shop instruments, while the Bozeman facility is dedicated to acoustic instruments.</p>

                    <p>Gibson purchased <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison_Guitars" target="blank">Garrison Guitars</a> in 2007. In mid 2009 Gibson reduced its work force to adjust for a decline in guitar industry sales in the United States.

                    <p>In 2011, Gibson acquired the <a href = "http://www.stantondj.com/" target="blank">Stanton Group</a>, including Cerwin Vega, KRK Systems and Stanton DJ. Gibson then formed a new division, Gibson Pro Audio, which will deliver professional grade audio items, including headphones, loudspeakers and DJ equipment.</p>
                    <p>Gibson announced a partnership with the Japanese-based Onkyo Corporation in 2012. Onkyo, known for audio equipment and home theater systems, became part of the Gibson Pro Audio division.</p>
